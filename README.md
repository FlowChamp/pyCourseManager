# pyCourseManager 0.1
A RESTful server to act as a database for school courses

## Setup
pyCourseManager currently expects a directory layout as follows:

Just kidding! It's all in MongoDB now!

Also bad design, but within friday.py there is commented out code which will
intialize the users db. It'll eventually be doable with a command line argument
or something.

## Dependencies
You will need the following Python packages, with a Python version >= 3.6 (gotta have those formatted strings!)
- pymongo
- flask
- flask-cors
- flask-login
- flask-restful
- flask-SQLAlchemy
- lxml
- requests
